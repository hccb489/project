# Background

The NEON data product used contains the quality-controlled, **native sampling resolution data** from in-situ measurements of **live and standing dead woody individuals and shrub groups**, from all terrestrial NEON sites with qualifying woody vegetation. The exact measurements collected per individual depend on **growth form**, and these measurements are focused on enabling **biomass** and **productivity** estimation, estimation of **shrub volume** and **biomass**, and calibration / validation of multiple NEON airborne **remote-sensing data products**. In general, comparatively large individuals that are visible to remote-sensing instruments are mapped, tagged and measured, and other smaller individuals are tagged and measured but not mapped. Smaller individuals may be subsampled according to a nested subplot approach in order to standardize the per plot sampling effort. Structure and mapping data are reported per individual per plot; sampling metadata, such as per growth form sampling area, are reported per plot. *For additional details, see the user guide, protocols, and science design listed in the Documentation section in this data product's details webpage.*

# Data

The data were downloaded from the NEON data portal and processed into a single table using script `data-raw/individual.R`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk(here::here("analysis.R"))
```

### Read in data and setup analysis

First we read in the data and select only the columns we are interested in, i.e `stem_diameter`, `height` and `growth_form`
```{r analysis-setup, message=FALSE}

```

### Prepare data

To prepare the data we exclude rows for which the value of `growth_form` was `NA` or `liana`.

```{r analysis-filter-data}

```


We also convert `growth_form` to a factor and set the levels according to to ascending counts of each level in the raw data.

```{r analysis-set-factor-levels}

```

```{r}
DT::datatable(analysis_df, caption = "Table 1: Prepared analysis data")
```

Our prepared data is a tibble of `r ncol(analysis_df)` columns and `r nrow(analysis_df)` rows.

### Data properties

#### Statistical summaries of our variables
```{r}
summary(analysis_df)
```

```{r analysis-fig1-barplot, fig.cap="Figure 1: Counts of growth forms"}

```

```{r analysis-fg2-violinplots, fig.cap="Figure 2: Distribution and statistical summaries of stem_diameter and height across growth forms."}

```

## Analysis

### Modelling overall `stem_diameter` as a function of `height`

Initially we fit a linear model of form `log(stem_diameter)` as a function of `log(height)`

```{r analysis-lm-overall}

```

Our model is statistically significant and has modest coverage, indicated by `r.squared` of `r broom::glance(lm_overall)$r.squared`

```{r analysis-lm-fig3-overall, fig.cap="Figure 3: Log stem diameter as a function of log height"}

```

However, plotting our data reveals sub groups in the data. We can examine whether including `growth_form` in our analysis would improve our model fit by capturing variation explained by differing relationships across growth forms


### Including an interaction with `growth_form`

We fit another model, this time including an interaction term for variable `growth_form`

```{r analysis-lm-growth}

```

Our model is still significant but this time explains a larger proportion of the variation (`r broom::glance(lm_growth)$r.squared`).

```{r analysis-lm-fig4-growth, fig.cap="Figure 4: Log stem diameter as a function of the interaction of log height and growth_form"}

```
